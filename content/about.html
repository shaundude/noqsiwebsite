	<h1>The Legend of John Doty</h1>
       	<p>John Doty began his career in high energy X-ray astronomy as a member of the MIT X-ray Balloon Group.
He received his Ph.D. for research carried out with SAS-3 on the binary X-ray source GX 1+4. He was pivotally involved in the research at MIT in which many of the properties of X-ray bursts were first established. He has contributed to many astromical instrumentation developments. He helped devise the All Sky Monitor for the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, and also helped design the architecture of its data system. He designed the electronics for the SNAPSHOT CCD camera on NASA's Kuiper Airborne Observatory: in 1988, this instrument achieved the first detection of Pluto's atmosphere. He was Project Engineer for the CCD Silicon Imaging Spectrometer (SIS) on the ASCA satellite. He is a co-investigator for the ACIS CCD focal plane array for the Chandra project, and designed the measurement chains for that instrument. He was Project Scientist for the HETE-1 satellite (destroyed by a launch vehicle failure in 1996), and is Project Scientist for HETE-2. He was a co-investigator, thermal designer, and electrical designer for the CCD focal planes on the ASTRO-E1 mission (launch vehicle failure, 2000), and is a co-investigator on its replacement, the Suzaku mission. He is a co-inventor of the event-driven CCD architecture (patent granted 2005), inventor of a very small, efficient and accurate digitizer for video (patent applied for 2006), and inventor of a spherical reaction wheel for controlling spacecraft attitude (patent applied for 2009). He is currently consulting on the design of the Soft X-ray Imaging instrument for the ASTRO-H mission.
